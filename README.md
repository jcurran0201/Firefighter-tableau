-	One major flaw was that the date was written in one column either as day, month,date,year or as day, date,month, year. This would make it very difficult to filter dates in tableau, so I separated these four attributes and put them in different columns using excel functions such as TEXTSPLIT and  LEFT. The dates being written in different orders in the original file made it challenging to clean the data, so I created 2 excel sheets based on the order of that the date was written (day, month,date,year OR as day, date,month, year) and then copied and pasted the sheets together correctly.
